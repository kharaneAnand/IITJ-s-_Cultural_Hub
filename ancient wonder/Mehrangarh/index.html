                    <p>The fort's name "Mehrangarh" derives from two words: "Mehr," meaning sun or Sun-deity (a reference to the clan's claimed descent from the Sun), and "garh," which means fort. Thus, Mehrangarh stands for "Fort of the Sun" ‚Äì a fitting name for a structure that dominates Jodhpur's skyline.</p>
                    
                    <p>Enclosed by imposing thick walls, Mehrangarh Fort houses several palaces known for their intricate carvings and expansive courtyards.
